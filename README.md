# Advent of Code 2022

__Problem Solving Exercises for the Holidays__

The Advent of Code project is run by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). This is my
first time participating in Advent of Code. I'm using this as an opportunity to
learn Python. I'm liking it more than I thought I would. It's gonna take a
while to learn the different ways that Python does things, but that's OK. I
might like the way they do things better than what I'm used to in PHP.
